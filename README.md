## C# Programming Fundamentals Project

## Introduction: 
In this respository, we cover the basic concepts of arrays (single dimensional array and two dimensional array), loops, conditional statements and inheritance. Arrays are used to store and manage  the data in single and two dimemsional form very efficiently. Loops and conditional statements are used to perform repeated tasks and also make program decisions such as student grading system. Oriented programming reuse the code and provide better structure. These concepts are very useful for building the strong  foundation of  C# beginners.

## Problems Details:

##1. 2 Dimensional Array:
.File: *2 dimensiona array program.cs 

.Description: In this program, we used two dimensional array in which data is stored and access in the form of rows and coloumns.

.Key concepts: .Two dimensional arrays 
               .Nested Loop
               .Rows and Coloumns

##2. 2 dimensional Array:
.File:* Program.cs 2 dimensional array

.Description: In this file, the main execution file run this program and also show the output.

.Key Concepts: .Main Method
               .Program Execution
               .Console Output

##3. Inheritance:
.File: *inheritance.cs

.Description: In this file, the concept of inheritence demonstrate in which one class inherit the properties of another class.

.Key Points: .Inheritance
             .Base Class
             .Derived Class
             .Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)

##4. Single dimensional Array:
.File: *single dimensional array program.cs

.Description: In this file, by using sinle dimensional array, we store and display the values.

.Key Points: .Single Dimensional Array
              .For Loop

##5. Students Grading system: 
.File: *students grading system.cs

.Description: This program caculates the grades of students on the basis of their marks by using the conditional statements.

.Key Points:  .Conditional Statements (if / else)
              .Variables
              .Logic Building
              .Real-life Problem Solving

## How to Run:
Open the visual studio. Then, load the file or project. 

Run the File of main().Output show on the console.
