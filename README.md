C# Programming Fundamentals Project
Introduction:
        In this respository, we cover the basic concepts of arrays (single dimensional array and two dimensional array), loops, conditional statements and inheritance. Arrays are used to store and manage  the data in single and two dimemsional form very efficiently. Loops and conditional statements are used to perform repeated tasks and also make program decisions such as student grading system. Oriented programming reuse the code and provide better structure. These concepts are very useful for building the strong  foundation of  C# beginners.
